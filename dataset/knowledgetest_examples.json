        "reply": "Your answer is well-structured and covers the essential ways in which IoT contributes to energy efficiency in smart homes. You correctly identified the role of smart thermostats and lighting systems in saving energy. To further enhance your answer, you could also mention the use of smart plugs that monitor and control energy usage of individual devices, or IoT-enabled energy monitoring systems that provide insights into consumption patterns, helping to identify further areas for efficiency improvements. Overall, excellent job!"
